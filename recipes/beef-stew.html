    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250-degrees F</li>
        <li>Heat up duch oven on stove low/medium heat for several minutes.</li>
        <li>Put all the chopped bacon in the dutch oven.
            Cook slowly, stirring frequently so pieces don't burn.</li>
        <li>While the bacon cooks, salt and pepper the beef cubes.</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, once the bacon begins crisping up
            or the fat begins to bubble, remove bacon and drain
            grease into bowl to use later. Or you can cook it further if you
            like crispy bacon.</li>
        <li>Pour some grease into the dutch oven and get it nice and hot (medium high).</li>
        <li>Brown all pieces. The goal is not to cook them, but just sear the outside.</li>
        <li>Using the fat from the beef and toss in chopped onions. Add more bacon grease
            or your preferred oil if there isn't enough in the pan.</li>
        <li>As they cook, lightly salt and pepper them.</li>
        <li>Cook slowly, stirring frequently for about 5-10 minutes or
            until onions are glassy and soft.</li>
        <li>Remove onions and place in a bowl. You can use the bacon bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn down heat to low and add the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cook down the tomatoes lightly salting to taste as you goal
            making sure to scrape any pan bits left over from the meat and onions.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add some of the stock and continue stirring. The goal being to cook down
            the tomatoes boiling off some of their water.</li>
        <li>Add in the beef, onions, bacon, carrots, celery and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough Gueness to come close to the top of all the ingredients.
            I.e. Not totally submersing the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in enough broth to just cover the ingredients and meat.</li>
        <li>Place 3 bay leaves in liquid on top.</li>
        <li>Cover and put it in the oven for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>About half way through, take it out, uncover it, and remove the fat
            building up at the top with a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>After 3 hours remove from oven, uncover and let sit for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>You may also see fat building up again, go ahead and remove that too.</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
