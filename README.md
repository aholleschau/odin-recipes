Building a basic HTML website for recipes

Leveraging recently learned knowledge of HTML elements such as headings,
paragraphs, anchors/links, and lists (both unordered and ordered), created a
home page that links to various other webpages that contain recipes.

Each recipe page incorporates embedding images using the <img> element
in addition to using the aforementioned elements (e.g. headings and lists).

This is a great exercise in understanding the basic structure of HTML
web pages as well as learning the importance and function of both absolute
and relative links (images and links to other pages both using a mix of absolute
and relative links).

Most of the content of the recipes was filler with Lorem Ipsum but that shouldn't
detract from the experience of learning the HTML format itself.
